# Ad-SpatialAnalysis_2024
In this study, we performed spatial omics analysis of lung adenocarcinoma to elucidate key molecular events for tumor cell progression in local tissue regions. We analyzed Visium data of 30 cases including eight invasive adenocarcinoma (IA) cases and 22 adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) cases. We also performed Xenium and PhenoCycler analyzes to validate the identified molecular events at a single-cell resolution.

- [Visium](./Visium): Spatial transcriptome sequencing (Visium). Scripts for deconvolution are also provided. 
- [Xenium](./Xenium): In situ expression profiling (Xenium).
- [PhenoCycler](./Spatial): Multiprelxed immunostaining (PhenoCycler).

- [TME scoring](./TME_scoring): Tumor microenvironment (TME) scoring using Visium data.
